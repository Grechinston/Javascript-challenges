/*
This time, John and his family went to 5 different restaurants. 
The bills were 124, 48, 268, 180 and 42.
John likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less
than 50, 15% when the bill is between 50 and 200, and 10% 
if the bill is more than 200.

Implement a tip calculator using objects and loops:
1.Create an object with an array for the bill values
2.Add a method to calculate the tip
3.This method should include a loop to iterate over all the paid 
bills and do the tip calculations
4.As an output, create 1) a new array containing all tips, and
 2) an array containing final paid amounts (bill+tip). 
HINT Start with two empty arrays as properties and then fill them up in the loop.
